          <h4>Difference between var, let and const keywords in JavaScript?</h4>
          <p>The scope of a var variable is functional scope.Var can be updated and re-declared into the scope.Var can be declared without initialization.The scope of a let variable is block scope.Let can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope.It can be declared without initialization.Const cannot be declared without initialization.The scope of a const variable is block scope.</p>

          <h4>Arrow function vs Regular function?</h4>
          <p>The first and most obvious difference between arrow functions and regular functions is their syntax. Not only do they look different, but arrow functions also provide an implicit return shorthand and allow parenthesis around a single argument to be omitted.Inside a regular function, execution context  is dynamic. This means that the value of this depends on how the function was invoked (simple invocation, method invocation, indirect invocation or constructor invocation). On the other hand, an arrow function does not define its own execution context.Due to arrow functions not defining their own execution context, they're not well-suited for usage as methods. However, thanks to the Class fields proposal, arrow functions can be used as methods inside classes, if your environment supports it.</p>

          <h4>Filter()/Find()/Map()/forEach() ?</h4>
          <p>The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function.The filter() method does not execute the function for empty elements.The filter() method does not change the original array.

            The find() method executes a function for each array element.The find() method returns undefined if no elements are found.The find() method does not execute the function for empty elements.The find() method does not change the original array.  
          
            map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element.map() calls a function once for each element in an array.map() does not execute the function for empty elements.map() does not change the original array.
            
            The forEach() method calls a function for each element in an array.The forEach() method is not executed for empty elements.</p>

          <h4>Why do we use template string in Javascript?</h4>
          <p>A multiline string: a string that can span multiple lines.
            String formatting: the ability to substitute part of the string for the values of variables or expressions. This feature is also called string interpolation.
            HTML escaping: the ability to transform a string so that it is safe to include in HTML.</p>
